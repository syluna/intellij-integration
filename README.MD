This plugin provides the ability to:
- Create New jMonkeyEngine projects with the required dependencies and a Main class.
    - File -> New Project -> Jmonkey
- Create scenes
    - Right-Click in Project window
- Modify scene properties.
    - Click on an item in Scene Explorer and edit in Property Editor
- Add supported objects (Nodes, ParticleEmitters, Lights, SkyBoxes, etc) to a scene.
    - Right-Click on an item in Scene Explorer
- Import, view and modify models.
    - Tools -> Import Model
- Add imported models to a scene.
    - Drag .j3o onto a Node in Scene Explorer

Next target(s)
- Provide support for custom editors.
    - This should allow users to create editors for things they create for jMonkeyEngine - much like unity allows.
