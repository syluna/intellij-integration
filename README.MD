![jetbrains version](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/v/12894-scala.svg) ![jetbrains downloads](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/d/12894-scala.svg)

This plugin provides the ability to:
- Create New jMonkeyEngine projects with the required dependencies and a Main class.
- Create scenes ( Tools -> Import Model )
- Modify scene properties.
- Add supported objects (Nodes, ParticleEmitters, etc) to a scene.
- Import, view and modify models.
- Add imported models to a scene.

Next target(s)
- Provide support for custom editors.
    - This should allow users to create editors for things they create for jMonkeyEngine - much like unity allows.
